                    <h2>Meet the Owners</h2>
                     Before purchasing the Super 322 Drive-In on April 1st in 2001, Bill had been working in theaters and drive-ins since he was a teenager. He has worked at the Ritz theater in Clearfield, the Rivoli theater in Altoona, and some other theaters and drive-ins in downtown Altoona.
                     <br><br>
                     In 1973, Bill was asked to go to the Midway drive-in in Mifflintown to help clean it up and make repairs after it was under 14 feet of water during hurricane Agnes the previous year. That was when he fell in love with drive-ins, as it was a completely different experience. He worked there through the 1976 drive-in season, then moved back to the Clearfield area and worked as a corrections officer for the county sheriff’s department.
                     <br><br>
                     In 1978, he married Barb, whom he met in 1966. She was also working for the Clearfield county government as an accountant. Coincidentally, Bill’s former boss from the Midway drive-in, together with his partner, bought the Super 322 Drive-In. They wanted him to come work for them as a projectionist, but Bill’s job made it impossible to do.
                     <br><br>
                     Later that year, Bill got a job with the state’s Department of Transportation, which made it possible for him to help out at the Midway Drive-In the next season.
                     <br><br>
                     Barb went with Bill to work and watch the movies while he ran the projectors, but soon she was asked to learn how to work in the ticket booth. Since she was attending Penn State at the time, she felt the extra cash could help her pay for books, so she learned to work the ticket booth. She later learned how to work the concessions, and that was when Barb fell in love with the business. After she finished selling tickets for the evening, she would bring her books to the projection booth and study while Bill ran the projectors.
                     <br><br>
                     Bill and Barb enjoyed their work at the Super 322. They saw it as a stress reliever after days working their respective jobs. They worked at the Super 322 through 2000, when they were offered to purchase it for themselves. Despite the extensive work needed to repair or replace aging buildings and equipment, they decided they were up to the challenge and purchased the drive-in in 2001.
                     <br><br>
                     Since owning the Super 322, they have replaced the marquee and added nostalgic neon, replaced the ticket office, restored one of the original “SUPER 322,” replaced fencing, renovated the office building below the screen, enlarge the concession building, added new menu items, and of course, converted to digital projection.
                     <br><br>
                     All of these projects required good planning and budgeting. Barb had the perfect skillset: Extensive experience in her career and her accounting and marketing degree from Penn State. Bill’s experience in management made him perfect for dealing with the public as well as his years working tin the theater business. Together they have 85 years combined experience in the move exhibition business. Most of those years they both were working their full0time jobs and also dedicating time to the drive-in.
                     <br><br>
                     There are plans for future improvements for the Super 322 as funds allow. Their goal is to keep the Super 322 Drive-In Theater in operation so generations to come can enjoy this special experience.

                    <h2>The United Drive-In Theater Owners Association</h2>
                    Even before purchasing the Super 322, Bill and Barb belonged to a drive-in theater fan club. The club would tour around and visit a variety of different drive-ins from all over. After noticing that all of the club members were either drive-in owners or managers, the people in charge of the club held a meeting at a drive-in in Baltimore.
                    <br><br>
                    At the meeting, the United Drive-In Theater Owners Association was created. Bill and Barb, with the Super 322, were one of the seven drive-ins that were represented. This association was formed to help preserve the nations drive-ins and support the people who own and manage them so they can stay open for as long as possible. The association has since grown to over 140 drive-in theaters.
