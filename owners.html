                    <h2>About Super 322</h2>
                    <h4>When was it established?</h4>
                        The Super 322 Drive-in Theatre was opened on May 26, 1950.  Built by the Theodore Grance Outdoor Theatre Co., ownership changed hands a few times until being bought in the 1970s by Royer and Favuzza from the Bellefonte area. They made improvements including AM radio; the Super 322 was Pennsylvania's second drive-in to add am AM radio sound system. In the 1980s, FM stereo sound capabilities were added.
                        <br>
                    <h4>Restoration of the Super 322</h4>
                        In 2001, the Super 322 Drive-in Theatre was granted eligibility to be listed in the National Register of Historic Places by the Pennsylvania Museum Commission.  In 2005, one the original neon signs was back in use after being restored.  It features pink neon.  The entrance lights have been replaced as has been the entire fence at the back of the field.  The ramps have all been graded and re-shaped so you can enjoy the best view of the big screen.  The ticket booth was replaced in 2010.
                        <br>
                    <h4>How many people and cars can it hold?</h4>
                        After the removal of external speakers the capacity of the drive-in  increased to about 650 cars.
